# Azure Speech to Text Transcoding

There are 3 scripts, each intended for transcoding mp3 and wav audios and the audio from mp4 videos.
You need to install ffmpeg for mp4 transcoding.

Additionally:

```
pip install azure-cognitiveservices-speech

```

Usage, for every media type:

```
python transcriber_mp3.py input_file.mp3

```
